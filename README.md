## Greetings!

I'm just another full-time employed programming geek, that is always looking for a side hustle :)

My interests include AI, Machine Learning, Networking, Optimizing things such as automating common tasks, finances, etc.


### Tech Stack

Currently I'm surveying the .NET stack, and thinking about minimizing the tech stack that I use, in order to be an expert at what I do, and not be a "jack of all trades, master of none".

- current tech stack
  - *Rust*
  - *NodeJs*
  - *Go*
  - *Python*
  - *C#*/[ASP].NET/Blazor
  - C++
- target minimized stack
  - *C#*/[ASP].NET/Blazor - general purposes, cloud, web, maui
  - *Python* - AI/ML, quick dirty scripts, pythong things I guess
  - *C++*/*Carbon* - performance gains, maybe CLIs
  - maybe *Rust* still... - see if I can hack writing CLIs in C++ first, keep for cloud stuff maybe...

### Permanent fixations

- Linear Algebra and its applications in ML and computer graphics
- dabbling in Category Theory
- thousands ways of brewing coffee
